# Daily Scheduler

## Description

This is a daily planner that allow users to make a schedule from 9AM-5PM. This application currently only has timeblocks from 9AM-5PM, but it's flexible for you to add more timeblocks if you wish. In the future, I would like to add different notification pop-ups according to the user's interaction with the webpage and create delete buttons to make it easier for users to remove an event.

The purpose of this project was to use third-party apis to create a web application. I'm still learning how to navigate through different api documentations to understand how they work and what methods I can use. I had issues implementing certain methods because of the version I linked to my webpage so in the future I hope to learn more about what I can implement in my webpages.

## Installation

1. Open your terminal window.
2. Use the `cd` command to navigate to your desired installation directory.
3. Copy and paste the following code in your terminal:

```
git clone git@github.com:tyang896/daily-scheduler.git
```

You can view a live demonstration of the application here: https://tyang896.github.io/daily-scheduler/

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file using your desired browser of choice. You should get a webpage that looks similar to the following:

(Note: the colors for each timeblock may differ for you because of the time and date. Gray = past, red = present, and green = future) 

2. To add an event, click on the the timeblock you wish to add an event.
